# SimpleTiles

More info will be here soon about SimpleTiles itself. Itch.io page: https://thesinkgod.itch.io/simpletiles

This repository has been uploaded as I am now interested in making SimpleTiles open source. It's also a great time to do such a thing since I'm about to refactor a good portion of the game's code because it's currently a huge mess. Modularization and readability is one of the big objectives here.
