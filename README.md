# SimpleTilesRefactor

This is a project to rewrite and modularize SimpleTiles in preperation for more advanced/gameplay critical features. It has also gone open source (as you can see).
The current code base is terrible and the plan at the moment is to modularize certain global/neccesary scripts into singletons that can be used anywhere, and to clean up existing code to be more readable and editable.
