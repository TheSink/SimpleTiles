This used to be a project to create a 2D exploration game in a similar vein to Minecraft, but ended up being abandoned after a few weeks.
This can be used as an example but I don't suggest anyone use it in a production/professional environment as it's kinda awful.
- No chunks, entire world is loaded at once
- Very messy code
- No efforts to optimize loading and saving process
- Just generally bad

so there you go
